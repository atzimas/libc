# The C Standard Library (C99)

The C Standard Library is a collection of useful functions and
types ready to-be used by C applications.

This implementation is based on the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 or,
more commonly known as, the C99 standard.

The target of this implementation is to provide a strong
educational basis for students to understand the inner
workings of the C Standard Library.

Nevertheless someone could build the library and use it instead
of the system's default C standard library.

## Building

To build a static version of the library:

    make static

To build a shared version of the library:

    make shared

To build everything:

    make
